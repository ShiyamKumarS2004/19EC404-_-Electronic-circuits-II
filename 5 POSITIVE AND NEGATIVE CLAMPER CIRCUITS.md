# Result
The Positive and Negative Clamper circuits were successfully constructed and tested. The positive clamper shifted the waveform upward by clamping the negative peaks to 0 V, while the negative clamper shifted the waveform downward by clamping the positive peaks to 0 V. Thus, both clampers operated correctly.
